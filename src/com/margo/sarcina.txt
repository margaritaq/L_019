Create a program
where you can enter data about a triangle in console,
and give all 3 sides
and the program outputs the area and the perimeter of that triangle (in console).


The operations of input, geometrical logic (getArea, getPerimeter) and output in console should be separated.

So for input you should have a class InputController which has a method createTriangle()
which returns a triangle after wrtiting in console all 3 sides inside this method.

For output you should have a class OutputController which has a method
printTriangleAreaAndPerimeter(Triangle triangle); which should not return anything but
should print the area and the perimeter of that triangle given as argument.

Of course it is needed to have a class Triangle with 3 properties - side1, side2, side3.
Also it should have the methods getArea() and getPerimeter().

In main you should have something like this:

Triangle triangle =  InputController.createTriangle();
OutputController.printTriangleAreaAndPerimeter(triangle);

Triangle triangle =  InputController.create(a,b,c);
OutputController.printAreaAndPerimeter(triangle);
